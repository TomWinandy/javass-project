# javass-project

This project was realized by Elior Papiernik & Tom Winandy in the context of the course CS-112.

The goal of this project, named Javass, is to have play the Jass game. Jass is a very popular card game in Switzerland — where it is often referred to as a national sport — and other neighboring countries, and is closely related to belote and other similar games.

There are many variations of Jass and this a quick introduction that explains the rules:
"Jass is played with four players, divided into two teams of two and placed around a table by alternating the teams, ie so that each player is surrounded by the two opposing players. Players use a deck of 36 cards, each of which has a suit (or suit) and a rank that
identify it. There are four different suits — spades (♠), hearts (♥), diamonds (♦), and clubs (♣) —and nine rows — 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jack, queen, king, and ace.
A game is played over a number of turns, until a team has accumulated a certain number of points — usually 1000 — at which point it is declared the winner.
At the start of each round, the 36 cards of the game are distributed randomly to the players, who therefore receive 9 each, which they do not show to anyone. One color among the four is designated as the trump card, which gives special characteristics to cards of that color: they are stronger than those of other colors, and can earn more points.
A game turn consists of a succession of 9 tricks. At the start of each trick, a determined player places a card from their hand on the table. The following players do the same, in order, but respecting certain rules. Basically, a player can either call by playing a card of the same suit as the first, or cut by playing a trump card.
When all the players have laid a card, the team that laid the highest card wins the trick, and all the points of the cards that compose it. The player with the highest card is the one who places the first card of the next trick.
The image below shows the second trick of the first round of a game of Jass. It's up to the human player (Ola) to play, and according to the rules he can only put down his ten or queen of spades, which is why these cards are highlighted."
